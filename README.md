# BlockChain
It was a final project of my 4th sem in DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS subject.
Professor has given a block chain schema that we had to create by implementing linked list which act as a single node of a tree.
One should be able to search for a node in tree
One can also delete a particluar node from tree.
Should also be able to add a node at any particular position.
IT WAS A FUN.
